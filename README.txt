Initialization:
The game starts by attaching a click event to the button using jQuery.
The match function is triggered when the button is clicked.
The game elements and variables are initialized, such as an array to store images, an array to store image objects, and variables to keep track of selected cards, found pairs, etc.

Fetching Images:
The fetchData function is responsible for fetching images from a URL (https://random.imagecdn.app/v1/image?width=120&height=120).
The number of pairs requested by the player is obtained from the input field.

Shuffling and Doubling:
The fetched images are assigned unique identifiers and stored in an array of image objects.
The array is then doubled, creating pairs of each image.
The Fisher-Yates algorithm is used to shuffle the array randomly.

Creating the Game Board:
The cardHolder function sets up the styling for the game board.
The handleImages function shuffles and creates the cards on the game board.
Each card has a front and back face, and clicking a card triggers the gameLogic function.

Game Logic:
When a card is clicked (createCard function), it toggles the class flipped, revealing the card's image.
The gameLogic function is triggered when two cards are flipped.
If the pair matches, the cards remain flipped, and the player scores a point.
If the pair doesn't match, the cards are flipped back after a delay.
The game continues until all pairs are found.

Audio Feedback:
Various audio files (gameStart.mp3, nicejob.mp3, allFound.mp3, wrongChoice.mp3) are played during different game events.
For example, a sound is played when a match is found, when all pairs are found, when a wrong choice is made, and at the start of the game.

Scoring:
The player's score, indicating the number of pairs found, is displayed on the game board.

Play Again:
When all pairs are found, the playAgain function is called.
This function resets the game variables, clears the game board, and allows the player to start a new game.

Styling:
The game has a visually appealing layout with styled cards and a responsive design.

User Input:
The player can input the number of pairs they want to play with before starting the game.

jQuery Usage:
Throughout the code, jQuery is used for DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio element selection.
